Interest groups, stakeholders, partners and ADA Holders may have discovered one or two limitations and/or concerns. Let's explore, collaborate and iterate this document to meet these yearnings. This is what Governance is all about. Specifically, I would love to see environment where the One ADA , ONE VOTE is refined to be more fair and equitable in the decision making processes of the ecosystem."
