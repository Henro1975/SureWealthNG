    "comment": "This proposal provides a stronger justification compared to the previous governance info action proposed. While it may still have areas for improvement, it does offer a data-driven rationale for the proposed 350M ADA limit in 2025. Below are cogent reasons why I will vote Yes for this structured, evidence-based info. action to treasury budgeting and most importantly, to prevent governance disruption in the growth and development of the ecosystem: \n\n1. Alignment with the Cardano Constitution:\n\n- The Cardano Constitution mandates that a Net Change Limit must be set for treasury withdrawals to be constitutional (Article IV, Section 3).\n  \n- Failure to approve a Net Change Limit would render all budget requests unconstitutional and inapplicable. This could stall ecosystem funding. \n\n2. Data-Backed Justification for 350M ADA: \n\n- The proposal provides an actual historical income figure:  \n- Treasury inflows from Jan 5, 2024 (Epoch 459) to Dec 30, 2024 (Epoch 531) = 335.96M ADA.  \n- October 2024 modeling projected** treasury growth at 351M ADA.  \n- Deviation between model and actual inflows is <5%, indicating reliability  \n- The proposal anchors the 2025 NCL to actual past inflows, ensuring a conservative and sustainable approach.  \n\n3. Stability & Predictability in Treasury Management: \n\n- The proposal maintains a clear, predictable budgeting framework, ensuring:  \n- Fiscal discipline—treasury spending will not exceed annual inflows  \n- Sustainable growth—budgeting remains consistent with ecosystem needs  \n- Strategic investments—projects receive funding without exhausting reserves  \n- It prevents uncertainty by establishing a structured budget cycle.    \n\n4. Logical Basis for Future NCL Adjustments: \n\n- The proposal sets a precedent for future Net Change Limits to be based on actual treasury inflows from the previous year.  \n- This creates a direct incentive for ecosystem projects to drive activity on Cardano, as increased adoption would increase treasury revenue.  \n \n5. Avoiding Treasury Freeze & Governance Deadlock:\n  \n- If this NCL is not approved, no budget actions can proceed.  \n- The Constitution does not specify an alternative in case an NCL is not set—meaning treasury withdrawals may be blocked indefinitely.  \n- This could cripple ecosystem growth, halting funding for infrastructure, community grants, and ecosystem development.\n\n6. Governance Legitimacy & Threshold Compliance: \n\nThe proposal acknowledges community feedback on setting the voting threshold at 67% but ultimately aligns with the Constitution’s requirement of >50% DRep stake approval.\nThis ensures constitutional compliance while remaining open to future governance refinements."
