    "comment": "The proposal presents a Net Change Limit for 2025 and 2026 but lacks concrete justifications with data-driven analysis. While it provides a rationale for maintaining treasury sustainability, it does not explicitly show why 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026 are optimal limits. Why should we blindl accept such a info action just because we want to maintain the treasury sustenance and avoid the drawbacks of not having such limit in place for the approval and implementation of budget proposals for the ecosystem for period under review.\n\nIdeally, I expected this proposal to include the following context and analysis in arriving at their rationale:\n\n1. Historical Data & Trends: Past treasury inflows/outflows and how it affected their rationale in the info action.\n\n2. Economic Modeling: Projections showing why these specific limits are sustainable and beneficial.\n\n3. Impact Assessment:What would happen if a higher or lower limit were set? What risks does the proposal mitigate?\n\nInstead, the proposal suggests approving the limits first and later debating potential increases, which may not be the most prudent approach. It also dismisses the percentage-based method due to complexity without sufficiently exploring its merits.\n\nI believe that this governance info action should be backed by quantifiable evidence. A well-informed decision requires data, not just broad rationale without sufficient justification. However the constitution has made it clear about the utmost important and implications of not arriving at approved Net Change Limits.\n\nThere is need for further clarification from the proposers on their rationale and economic modeling thus an amendment to this Net Change Limits info action proposal or such future actions should include historical data, spending projections, or alternative NCL approaches (e.g., percentage-based) for consideration. Consequently, am voting No to this info action while advocating for a better-structured NCL proposal in the future.\n"
