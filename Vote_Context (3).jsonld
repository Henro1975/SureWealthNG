    "comment": "I have voted YES to ratify the proposed Net Change Limit (NCL) of 200M ada for the period covering Epoch 532 to Epoch 604 (rest of 2025). This action is a necessary governance step to allow treasury withdrawals and facilitate continued growth of the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nMy Rationale for Voting YES:\n\nI. Constitutional Requirement\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the Cardano Constitution mandates that an NCL must be established before any treasury funds can be withdrawn. This Info Action ensures compliance and operational functionality.\n\nII. Responsible Treasury Management\nThe proposed NCL (200M ada) takes a cautious and sustainable approach, below the estimated annual Treasury inflows (~350M ada). This protects the Treasury principal while enabling necessary ecosystem funding.\n\nIII. Governance Maturity & Risk Management\nAs this is the first on-chain governance cycle under the new framework, a conservative NCL allows time to refine budget processes, audit methods, and understand funding impacts. This approach mitigates financial and market risks.\n\nIV. Ecosystem Continuity & Growth\nApproving the NCL ensures essential operations, development, and scaling initiatives can be funded during 2025. It supports Cardano’s long-term vision while safeguarding community assets.\n\nV. Flexibility for Future Adjustments\nThis NCL is not permanent. It can be reviewed and adjusted in future governance actions based on experience and evolving needs.\n\nConclusion\nBy voting YES, I uphold the Cardano Constitution, ensure responsible treasury stewardship, and support the ecosystem’s sustainable growth. This vote enables the community to proceed with necessary budgeting and funding while carefully managing treasury resources."
