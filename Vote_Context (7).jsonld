It has been a critical enabler of dApp development across our ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal specifically supports:\n\nThe Icebreakers Program: A decentralization initiative that rewards Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators for handling API traffic, reducing centralization risks.\n\nOpen-source delivery: All tools and infrastructure funded by this proposal will be released under open-source licenses to ensure transparency, prevent vendor lock-in, and foster community innovation.\n\nAudited, milestone-based treasury disbursement: The ₳1.3M requested will be managed under strict legal contracts, released only upon verified completion of milestones, and tracked via smart contracts audited by MLabs and TxPipe.\n\nThird-party oversight: Intersect manages this project under the supervision of an independent Oversight Committee, including trusted entities such as Cardano Foundation, NMKR, and Xerberus.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal aligns with the approved ecosystem budget (gov_action1u9x73...), fulfills all constitutional requirements, and supports Cardano’s long-term goals of decentralization, developer accessibility, and infrastructure resilience.\n\nI believe this proposal is in the best interest of the Cardano ecosystem and its future."
