    "comment": "As a delegated representative committed to the long-term success of Cardano, I have voted YES on this treasury withdrawal for the following reasons:\n\nStrategic Investment in Catalyst Infrastructure\nThis proposal funds critical upgrades to the Catalyst platform through three focused workstreams:\n\nA new Catalyst interface to support multiple funding models\n\nA decentralized infrastructure powered by Hermes\n\nExecution of three funding rounds (F14–F16) and a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program.\nThese upgrades are vital for scalability, security, and broader community participation.\n\nEcosystem Impact and Value for Money\n₳61 million will go directly to fund builders, researchers, and innovators in the community. The proposed improvements are expected to cut future operational costs by up to 50% and increase voter inclusiveness and fairness through features like Quadratic Voting and mobile-first participation tools.\n\nStrong Governance and Oversight\nThis action is part of the ₳275M budget previously approved by the community. It follows constitutional requirements with:\n\nA clear Legal Contract, milestone tracking, and public delivery reporting\n\nOn-chain smart contract-based fund management, audited by MLabs and TxPipe\n\nA robust oversight mechanism involving Intersect and five independent third-party verifiers (Cardano Foundation, Sundae Labs, NMKR, Xerberus, DQuadrant).\n\nTrusted Vendor with Proven Delivery\nInput Output’s Catalyst team has a solid track record, having:\n\nManaged 13 Catalyst rounds\n\nProcessed over 3 million governance decisions\n\nAllocated ₳290M to over 2,000 projects globally\n\nInnovated decentralized voting tools aligned with Cardano’s goals.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe this proposal represents a well-structured, high-impact use of treasury funds that aligns with Cardano's Constitution and 2025 roadmap.\n\nI have voted YES to support a sustainable, decentralized future for Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem."
