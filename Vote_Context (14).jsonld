    "comment": "This proposal funds the development of a zero-knowledge (ZK) bridge to enhance secure and trust-minimized interoperability between Cardano and other blockchains. It directly addresses one of Cardano's critical gaps—the lack of native, decentralized cross-chain infrastructure—by providing a ZK-proof-based mechanism for secure asset transfers.\n\nThe vendor, Eryx Coop, is a well-qualified team with a proven track record in ZK cryptography, Aiken development, and open-source contributions, including the Lambdaworks library and CircleSTARKS. Their solution leverages Cardano’s native capabilities and lays groundwork for future ZK rollups, privacy-preserving apps, and scalability features.\n\nThis initiative aligns with the approved Intersect-administered budget and will follow strong delivery assurance and milestone-based accountability under legal contract. Given the pressing need for secure interoperability and the vendor’s expertise, this project is a strategic investment in Cardano’s future.\n\nI am voting YES to unlock Cardano’s interoperability potential with a secure ZK bridge."
